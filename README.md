# Detecting-COVID-19---with-chest-x-ray-using-pytorch
In this guided project, ResNet-18 model was used and was trained on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset. This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. The objective in this project was to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belonged to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy.

# Guided Project Objectives
In this guided project, we focused on the following learning objectives:

-->Create custom Dataset and DataLoader in PyTorch

-->Train a ResNet-18 model in PyTorch to perform Image Classification

This guided project helped to create an understanding about Convolutional Neural Networks and train it to classify Chest X-Ray scans with reasonably high accuracy.

# Project Structure
The hands on project on Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray using PyTorch was divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Introduction

Task 2: Importing Libraries

Task 3: Creating Custom Dataset

Task 4: Image Transformations

Task 5: Prepare DataLoader

Task 6: Data Visualization

Task 7: Creating the Model

Task 8: Training the Model

Task 9: Final Results

# Final result
Finally, it detects the x-rays are Normal, Viral Pneumonia or COVID-19 . Just like the images displayed below.
